# Numpy-
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra and matrices.
Numerical Python (NumPy) supports multidimensional arrays over which you can easily apply mathematical operations.

# Numpy-
In NumPy library first i compare range function in python and numpy  then check which method take more time to run
check memory and generate Numpy array using List.
Then I generate NumPy array using built in functions.
Generate array using  Zeros and Ones and then use linspace and eye method
after that i generate random numbers using random,randn,randint 
Distribution of array using shape and reshape method

# Indexing matrix-
Generate numpy array
use of np.where method
use of slicing

# Numpy Operations-
how to use sort()
exp()
sqrt()
sin()
log()
